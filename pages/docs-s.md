# Neatline for Omeka S: Development Release v0.3.0

Here's our most recent development release of Neatline for Omeka S: [version 0.3.0](https://github.com/scholarslab/neatline-omeka-s/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

Major updates include:
- Compatibility with Omeka S 2.0
- Requires Omeka S 2.0 or higher

Neatline for Omeka S is still in development, and this version is not yet ready for production use. We are continuing work on the module, and will do incremental 0.x releases until we’re ready to offer a stable, production-ready 1.0 version. Currently, we are on schedule to release Neatline for Omeka S by September 2020. Please continue to check here for any updates.
