# Status of Neatline Support
Neatline user/developer support and development is on hiatus while we seek a different institution to take over its future maintenance, development, and support.

We regret the difficulties this causes current users. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to continue providing these public services at an acceptable level.

We are unable to provide user or developer support, and will not be able to make further changes or updates to the code or documentation.

# Neatline for Omeka S: Development Release v0.3.0

Here's our most recent development release of Neatline for Omeka S: [version 0.3.0](https://github.com/scholarslab/neatline-omeka-s/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

Major updates include:
- Compatibility with Omeka S 2.0
- Requires Omeka S 2.0 or higher

Neatline for Omeka S is still in development, and this version is not yet ready for production use. We are continuing work on the module, and will do incremental 0.x releases until we’re ready to offer a stable, production-ready 1.0 version. Currently, we are on schedule to release Neatline for Omeka S by September 2020. Please continue to check here for any updates.
