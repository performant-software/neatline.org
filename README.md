# neatline.org-new
New Neatline site including docs

# Status update
Neatline user/developer support and development is on hiatus while we seek a different institution to take over its future maintenance, development, and support.

We regret the difficulties this causes current users. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to continue providing these public services at an acceptable level.

We are unable to provide user or developer support, and will not be able to make further changes or updates to the code or documentation.
